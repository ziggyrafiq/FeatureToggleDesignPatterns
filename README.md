# Using Factory Patterns in C# 12 to Simplify A/B Testing (FeatureToggleDesignPatterns)

## Overview
The Factory and Abstract Factory design patterns simplify A/B testing in C# 12 with feature toggles. Ziggy Rafiq demonstrates how these patterns can be used to dynamically activate features and choose UI themes in complex software systems, improving flexibility, modularity, and maintainability. By using these patterns, A/B testing is streamlined, feature toggles can be managed, scaled, and maintained more easily.
